#+title: BFS Aligner

This is a simple sequence-to-graph aligner that does unit-cost edit distance
extension alignments.
It takes a ~.gfa~ graph and a Fasta file, and aligns the (only/first) sequence
in the file to the graph.

Usage:
#+begin_src
cargo run --release -- ./test/t1.gfa ./test/t1.fa
#+end_src

Note that the test directory is copied form the
[[https://github.com/lh3/gwfa][GWFA repo]].


*** Alignment type
This solves extension alignment as introduced by [[https://github.com/lh3/gwfa][GWFA]]:
The start of the query is aligned to start of the first vertex in the graph.

Note that they call it /global alignment/, but since only the start it fixed
here, /half-global/ would be more accurate, but this seems to simple be
/extension alignment/ (on a graph) in practice.
